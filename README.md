</i></summary><blockquote><p align="justify">
Knowledge-based natural language processing systems have achieved good success with certain tasks but they are often criticized because they depend on a domain-specific dictionary that requires a great deal of manual knowledge engineering. This knowledge engineering bottleneck makes knowledge-based NLP systems impractical for real-world applications because they cannot be easily scaled up orported to new domains. In response to this problem, we developed a system called AutoSlog that automatically builds a domain-specific dictionary of concepts for extracting information from text. Using AutoSlog. we constructed a dictionary for the domain of terrorist event descriptions in only 5 person-hours. We then compared the AutoSlog dictionary with a hand-crafted dictionary that was built by two highly skilled graduate students and required approximately 1500 person-hours of effort. We evaluated the two dictionaries using two blind test sets of 100 texts each. Overall, the AutoSlog dictionary achieved 98% of the performance of the hand-crafted dictionary. On the first test set, the Auto-Slog dictionary obtained 96.3% of the perfomlance of the hand-crafted dictionary. On the second test set, the overall scores were virtually indistinguishable with the AutoSlog dictionary achieving 99.7% of the performance of the handcrafted dictionary.

</i></summary><blockquote><p align="justify">
The paper presents an automatic acquisition of linguistic patterns that can be used for knowledge based information extraction from texts. In knowledge based information extraction, linguistic patterns play a central role in the recognition and classification of input texts. Although the knowledge based approach has been proved effective for information extraction on limited domains, there are difficulties in construction of a large number of domain specific linguistic patterns. Manual creation of patterns is time consuming and error prone, even for a small application domain. To solve the scalability and the portability problem, an automatic acquisition of patterns must be provided. We present the PALKA (Parallel Automatic Linguistic Knowledge Acquisition) system that acquires linguistic patterns from a set of domain specific training texts and their desired outputs. A specialized representation of patterns called FP structures has been defined. Patterns are constructed in the form of FP structures from training texts, and the acquired patterns are tuned further through the generalization of semantic constraints. Inductive learning mechanism is applied in the generalization step. The PALKA system has been used to generate patterns for our information extraction system developed for the fourth Message Understanding Conference (MUC-4).

Previous work on automated dictionary construction for information extraction has relied on annotated text corpora. However, annotating a corpus is time-consuming and difficult. We propose that conceptual patterns for information extraction can be acquired automatically using only a preclassified training corpus and no text annotations. We describe a system called AutoSlog-TS, which is a variation of our previous AutoSlog system, that runs exhaustively on an untagged text corpus. Text classification experiments in the MUC-4 terrorism domain show that the AutoSlog-TS dictionary performs comparably to a hand-crafted dictionary, and actually achieves higher precision on one test set. For text classification, AutoSlog-TS requires no manual effort beyond the preclassified training corpus. Additional experiments suggest how a dictionary produced by AutoSlog-TS can be filtered automatically for information extraction tasks. Some manual intervention is still required in this case, but AutoSlog-TS significantly reduces the amount of effort required to create an appropriate training corpus.

A growing population of users want to extract a growing variety of information from on-line texts. Unfortunately, current information extraction systems typically require experts to hand-build dictionaries of extraction patterns for each new type of information to be extracted. This paper presents a system that can learn dictionaries of extraction patterns directly from user-provided examples of texts and events to be extracted from them. The system, called LIEP, learns patterns that recognize relationships between key constituents based on local syntax. Sets of patterns learned by LIEP for a sample extraction task perform nearly at the level of a hand-built dictionary of patterns.

Information extraction systems usually require two dictionaries: a semantic lexicon and a dictionary of extraction patterns for the domain. We present a multilevel bootstrapping algorithm that generates both the semantic lexicon and extraction patterns simultaneously. As input, our technique requires only unannotated training texts and a handful of seed words for a category. We use a mutual bootstrapping technique to alternately select the best extraction pattern for the category and bootstrap its extractions into the semantic lexicon, which is the basis for selecting the next extraction pattern. To make this approach more robust, we add a second level of bootstrapping (metabootstrapping) that retains only the most reliable lexicon entries produced by mutual bootstrapping and then restarts the process. We evaluated this multilevel bootstrapping technique on a collection of corporate web pages and a corpus of terrorism news articles. The algorithm produced high-quality dictionaries for several semantic categories.

In developing an Information Extraction (IE) system for a new class of events or relations, one of the major tasks is identifying the many ways in which these events or relations may be expressed in text. This has generally involved the manual analysis and, in some cases, the annotation of large quantities of text involving these events. This paper presents an alternative approach, based on an automatic discovery procedure, ExDisco, which identi es a set of relevant documents and a set of event patterns from un-annotated text, starting from a small set of seed patterns." We evaluate ExDisco by comparing the performance of discovered patterns against that of manually constructed systems on actual extraction tasks.

(LP)2 is a covering algorithm for adaptive Information Extraction from text (IE). It induces symbolic rules that insert SGML tags into texts by learning from examples found in a user-defined tagged corpus. Training is performed in two steps: initially a set of tagging rules is learned; then additional rules are induced to correct mistakes and imprecision in tagging. Induction is performed by bottom-up generalization of examples in the training corpus. Shallow knowledge about Natural Language Processing (NLP) is used in the generalization process. The algorithm has a considerable success story. From a scientific point of view, experiments report excellent results with respect to the current state of the art on two publicly available corpora. From an application point of view, a successful industrial IE tool has been based on (LP)2. Real world applications have been developed and licenses have been released to external companies for building other applications. This paper presents (LP)2, experimental results and applications, and discusses the role of shallow NLP in rule induction.

Electronic information grows rapidly as the Internet is widely used in our daily life. In order to identify the exact information for the user query, information extraction is widely researched and investigated. The template, which pertains to events or situations, and contains slots that denote who did what to whom, when, and where, is predefined by a template builder. Therefore, fixed templates are the main obstacles for the information extraction system out of the laboratory. In this paper, a method to automatically discover the event pattern in Chinese from stock market bulletin is introduced. It is based on the tagged corpus and the domain model. The pattern discovery process is independent of the domain model by introducing a link table. The table is the connection between text surface structure and semantic deep structure represented by a domain model. The method can be easily adapted to other domains by changing the link table.

We also report on extensions that did not improve results. The system performs very well on TDT3 and TDT4 test data and scored second in the TDT-2002 evaluation.

Mooney</i></summary><blockquote><p align="justify">
Information extraction is a form of shallow text processing that locates a specified set of relevant items in a natural-language document. Systems for this task require significant domain-specific knowledge and are time-consuming and difficult to build by hand, making them a good application for machine learning. We present an algorithm, RAPIER, that uses pairs of sample documents and filled templates to induce pattern-match rules that directly extract fillers for the slots in the template. RAPIER is a bottom-up learning algorithm that incorporates techniques from several inductive logic programming systems. We have implemented the algorithm in a system that allows patterns to have constraints on the words, part-of-speech tags, and semantic classes present in the filler and the surrounding text. We present encouraging experimental results on two domains.

Several approaches have been described for the automatic unsupervised acquisition of patterns for information extraction. Each approach is based on a particular model for the patterns to be acquired, such as a predicate-argument structure or a dependency chain. The effect of these alternative models has not been previously studied. In this paper, we compare the prior models and introduce a new model, the Subtree model, based on arbitrary subtrees of dependency trees. We describe a discovery procedure for this model and demonstrate experimentally an improvement in recall using Subtree patterns.

Methods have been developed for the automatic identification of event extents andevent triggers.  We have learned patterns for a particular domain,  i.e.,  prize  award  events.  Currently  we  are systematically investigating the criteria for selecting the most effective patterns for the detection of events in sentences  and  paragraphs.  Although  the  systematic investigation is still under way, we can already report on first very promising results of the method for learning of patterns and for using these patterns in event detection.

Due to the market sensitivity to emerging news, investors on financial markets need to continuously monitor financial events when deciding on buying and selling equities. We propose the use of lexico-semantic patterns for financial event extraction from RSS news feeds. These patterns use financial ontologies, leveraging the commonly used lexico-syntactic patterns to a higher abstraction level, thereby enabling lexico-semantic patterns to identify more and more precisely events than lexico-syntactic patterns from text. We have developed rules based on lexico-semantic patterns used to find events, and semantic actions that allow for updating the domain ontology with the effects of the discovered events. Both the lexico-semantic patterns and the semantic actions make use of the triple paradigm that fosters their easy construction and understanding by the user. Based on precision, recall, and F1 measures, we show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Several researchers have proposed semi-supervised learning methods for adapting event extraction systems to new event types. This paper investigates two kinds of bootstrapping methods used for event extraction: the document-centric and similarity-centric approaches, and proposes a filtered ranking method that combines the advantages of the two. We use a range of extraction tasks to compare the generality of this method to previous work. We analyze the results using two evaluation metrics and observe the effect of different training corpora. Experiments show that our new ranking method not only achieves higher performance on different evaluation metrics, but also is more stable across different bootstrapping corpora.

</i></summary><blockquote><p align="justify">
The scientific literature is the main source for comprehensive, up-to-date biological knowledge. Automatic extraction of this knowledge facilitates core biological tasks, such as database curation and knowledge discovery. We present here a linguistically inspired, rule-based and syntax-driven methodology for biological event extraction. We rely on a dictionary of trigger words to detect and characterize event expressions and syntactic dependency based heuristics to extract their event arguments. We refine and extend our prior work to recognize speculated and negated events. We show that heuristics based on syntactic dependencies, used to identify event arguments, extend naturally to also identify speculation and negation scope. In the BioNLP’09 Shared Task on Event Extraction, our system placed third in the Core Event Extraction Task (F-score of 0.4462), and first in the Speculation and Negation Task (F-score of 0.4252). Of particular interest is the extraction of complex regulatory events, where it scored second place. Our system significantly outperformed other participating systems in detecting speculation and negation. These results demonstrate the utility of a syntax-driven approach. In this article, we also report on our more recent work on supervised learning of event trigger expressions and discuss event annotation issues, based on our corpus analysis.

Most event extraction systems are trained with supervised learning and rely on a collection of annotated documents. Due to the domain-specificity of this task, event extraction systems must be retrained with new annotated data for each domain. In this paper, we propose a bootstrapping solution for event role filler extraction that requires minimal human supervision. We aim to rapidly train a state-of-the-art event extraction system using a small set of "seed nouns" for each event role, a collection of relevant (in-domain) and irrelevant (out-of-domain) texts, and a semantic dictionary. The experimental results show that the bootstrapped system outperforms previous weakly supervised event extraction systems on the MUC-4 data set, and achieves performance levels comparable to supervised training with 700 manually annotated documents.

We describe the design, development, and API of ODIN (Open Domain INformer), a domain- independent, rule-based event extraction (EE) framework. The proposed EE approach is: simple (most events are captured with simple lexico-syntactic patterns), powerful (the language can capture complex constructs, such as events taking other events as arguments, and regular expressions over syntactic graphs), robust (to recover from syntactic parsing errors, syntactic patterns can be freely mixed with surface, token-based patterns), and fast (the runtime environment processes 110 sentences/second in a real-world domain with a grammar of over 200 rules). We used this framework to develop a grammar for the bio-chemical domain, which approached human performance. Our EE framework is accompanied by a web-based user interface for the rapid development of event grammars and visualization of matches. The ODIN framework and the domain-specific grammars are available as open-source code.

Event Detection (ED), one aspect of Information Extraction, involves identifying instances of specified types of events in text. Much of the research on ED has been based on the specifications of the 2005 ACE [Automatic Content Extraction] event task 1 , and the associated annotated corpus. However, as the event instances in the ACE corpus are not evenly distributed, some frequent expressions involving ACE events do not appear in the training data, adversely affecting performance. In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of a Pattern Expansion technique to import frequent patterns extracted from external corpora to boost ED performance. The experimental results show that our pattern-based system with the expanded patterns can achieve 70.4% (with 1.6% absolute improvement) F-measure over the baseline, an advance over current state-of-the-art systems.

Event Extraction is an important research point in the area of Information Extraction.

A novel method combining event trigger expansion and a binary classifier is presented in the step of event type recognition while in the step of argument recognition, one with multi-class classification based on maximum entropy is introduced. The above methods solved the data unbalanced problem in training model and the data sparseness problem brought by the small set of training data effectively, and finally our event extraction system achieved a better performance.

We apply the hypothesis of "One Sense Per Discourse" (Yarowsky, 1995) to information extraction (IE), and extend the scope of "discourse" from one single document to a cluster of topically-related documents. We employ a similar approach to propagate consistent event arguments across sentences and documents. Combining global evidence from related documents with local decisions, we design a simple scheme to conduct cross-document inference for improving the ACE event extraction task 1 . Without using any additional labeled data this new approach obtained 7.6% higher F-Measure in trigger labeling and 6% higher F-Measure in argument labeling over a state-of-the-art IE system which extracts events independently for each sentence.

We describe a system for extracting complex events among genes and proteins from biomedical literature, developed in context of the BioNLP’09 Shared Task on Event Extraction. For each event, the system extracts its text trigger, class, and arguments. In contrast to the approaches prevailing prior to the shared task, events can be arguments of other events, resulting in a nested structure that better captures the underlying biological statements. We divide the task into independent steps which we approach as machine learning problems. We define a wide array of features and in particular make extensive use of dependency parse graphs. A rule‐based postprocessing step is used to refine the output in accordance with the restrictions of the extraction task. In the shared task evaluation, the system achieved an F‐score of 51.95% on the primary task, the best performance among the participants. Currently, with modifications and improvements described in this article, the system achieves 52.86% F‐score on Task 1, the primary task, improving on its original performance. In addition, we extend the system also to Tasks 2 and 3, gaining F‐scores of 51.28% and 50.18%, respectively. The system thus addresses the BioNLP’09 Shared Task in its entirety and achieves the best performance on all three subtasks.

Biomedical Natural Language Processing (BioNLP) attempts to capture biomedical phenomena from texts by extracting relations between biomedical entities (i.e. proteins andgenes).  Traditionally,  only binary relations  have  been  extracted  from large numbers of published papers. Recently, more complex relations (biomolecular events) have also been extracted. Such events may include several entities or other relations. To evaluate the performance of the text mining systems, several shared task challenges have been arranged for the BioNLP community. With a common and consistent task setting, theBioNLP’09 shared task evaluated complex biomolecular events such as binding and regulation. Finding these events automatically is important in order to improve biomedical event extraction systems. In the present paper, we propose an automatic event extraction system, which contains a model for complex events, by solving a classification problem with rich features. The main contributions of the present paper are: (1) the proposal of an effective bio-event detection method using machine learning, (2) provision of a high-performance event extraction system, and (3) the execution of a quantitative error analysis. The proposed complex (binding and regulation) event detector outperforms the best system from the BioNLP’09 shared task challenge.

There has recently been a notable shift in biomedical information extraction (IE) from relation models toward the more expressive event model, facilitated by the maturation of basic tools for biomedical text analysis and the availability of manually annotated resources. The event model allows detailed representation of complex natural language statements and can support a number of advanced text mining applications ranging from semantic search to pathway extraction. A recent collaborative evaluation demonstrated the potential of event extraction systems, yet there have so far been no studies of the generalization ability of the systems nor the feasibility of large-scale extraction. This study considers event-based IE at PubMed scale. We introduce a system combining publicly available, state-of-the-art methods for domain parsing, named entity recognition and event extraction, and test the system on a representative 1% sample of all PubMed citations. We present the first evaluation of the generalization performance of event extraction systems to this scale and show that despite its computational complexity, event extraction from the entire PubMed is feasible. We further illustrate the value of the extraction approach through a number of analyses of the extracted information.

Event extraction is a particularly challenging type of information extraction (IE). Most current event extraction systems rely on local information at the phrase or sentence level. However, this local context may be insufficient to resolve ambiguities in identifying particular types of events; information from a wider scope can serve to resolve some of these ambiguities. In this paper, we use document level information to improve the performance of ACE event extraction. In contrast to previous work, we do not limit ourselves to information about events of the same type, but rather use information about other types of events to make predictions or resolve ambiguities regarding a given event. We learn such relationships from the training corpus and use them to help predict the occurrence of events and event arguments in a text. Experiments show that we can get 9.0% (absolute) gain in trigger (event) classification, and more than 8% gain for argument (role) classification in ACE event extraction.

Event extraction is a particularly challenging type of information extraction (IE) that may require inferences from the whole article. However, most current event extraction systems rely on local information at the phrase or sentence level, and do not consider the article as a whole, thus limiting extraction performance. Moreover, most annotated corpora are artificially enriched to include enough positive samples of the events of interest; event identification on a more balanced collection, such as unfiltered newswire, may perform much worse. In this paper, we investigate the use of unsupervised topic models to extract topic features to improve event extraction both on test data similar to training data, and on more balanced collections. We compare this unsupervised approach to a supervised multi-label text classifier, and show that unsupervised topic modeling can get better results for both collections, and especially for a more balanced collection. We show that the unsupervised topic model can improve trigger, argument and role labeling by 3.5%, 6.9% and 6% respectively on a pre-selected corpus, and by 16.8%, 12.5% and 12.7% on a balanced corpus.

Extracting biomedical events from literature has attracted much recent attention. The best-performing systems so far have been pipelines of simple subtask-specific local classifiers. A natural drawback of such approaches are cascading errors introduced in early stages of the pipeline. We present three joint models of increasing complexity designed to overcome this problem. The first model performs joint trigger and argument extraction, and lends itself to a simple, efficient and exact inference algorithm. The second model captures correlations between events, while the third model ensures consistency between arguments of the same event. Inference in these models is kept tractable through dual decomposition. The first two models outperform the previous best joint approaches and are very competitive with respect to the current state-of-the-art. The third model yields the best results reported so far on the BioNLP 2009 shared task, the BioNLP 2011 Genia task and the BioNLP 2011 Infectious Diseases task.

This paper presents a new approach to exploit coreference information for extracting event-argument (E-A) relations from biomedical documents. This approach has two advantages: (1) it can extract a large number of valuable E-A relations based on the concept of salience in discourse; (2) it enables us to identify E-A relations over sentence boundaries (cross-links) using transitivity of coreference relations. We propose two coreference-based models: a pipeline based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers, and a joint Markov Logic Network (MLN). We show the effectiveness of these models on a biomedical event corpus. Both models outperform the systems that do not use coreference information. When the two proposed models are compared to each other, joint MLN outperforms pipeline SVM with gold coreference information.

Biomedical event extraction has attracted substantial attention as it can assist researchers in understanding the plethora of interactions among genes that are described in publications in molecular biology. While most recent work has focused on abstracts, the BioNLP 2011 shared task evaluated the submitted systems on both abstracts and full papers. In this article, we describe our submission to the shared task which decomposes event extraction into a set of classification tasks that can be learned either independently or jointly using the search-based structured prediction framework. Our intention is to explore how these two learning paradigms compare in the context of the shared task. We report that models learned using search-based structured prediction exceed the accuracy of independently learned classifiers by 8.3 points in F-score, with the gains being more pronounced on the more complex Regulation events (13.23 points). Furthermore, we show how the trade-off between recall and precision can be adjusted in both learning paradigms and that search-based structured prediction achieves better recall at all precision points. Finally, we report on experiments with a simple domain-adaptation method, resulting in the second-best performance achieved by a single system. We demonstrate that joint inference using the search-based structured prediction framework can achieve better performance than independently learned classifiers, thus demonstrating the potential of this learning paradigm for event extraction and other similarly complex information-extraction tasks.

Biomedical events extraction concerns about events describing changes on the state of bio-molecules from literature. Comparing to the protein-protein interactions (PPIs) extraction task which often only involves the extraction of binary relations between two proteins, biomedical events extraction is much harder since it needs to deal with complex events consisting of embedded or hierarchical relations among proteins, events, and their textual triggers. In this paper, we propose an information extraction system based on the hidden vector state (HVS) model, called HVS-BioEvent, for biomedical events extraction, and investigate its capability in extracting complex events. HVS has been previously employed for extracting PPIs. In HVS-BioEvent, we propose an automated way to generate abstract annotations for HVS training and further propose novel machine learning approaches for event trigger words identification, and for biomedical events extraction from the HVS parse results. Our proposed system achieves an F-score of 49.57% on the corpus used in the BioNLP'09 shared task, which is only 2.38% lower than the best performing system by UTurku in the BioNLP'09 shared task. Nevertheless, HVS-BioEvent outperforms UTurku's system on complex events extraction with 36.57% vs. 30.52% being achieved for extracting regulation events, and 40.61% vs. 38.99% for negative regulation events. The results suggest that the HVS model with the hierarchical hidden state structure is indeed more suitable for complex event extraction since it could naturally model embedded structural context in sentences.

Nested event structures are a common occurrence in both open domain and domain specific extraction tasks, e.g., a "crime" event can cause a "investigation" event, which can lead to an "arrest" event. However, most current approaches address event extraction with highly local models that extract each event and argument independently. We propose a simple approach for the extraction of such structures by taking the tree of event-argument relations and using it directly as the representation in a reranking dependency parser. This provides a simple framework that captures global properties of both nested and flat event structures. We explore a rich feature space that models both the events to be parsed and context from the original supporting text. Our approach obtains competitive results in the extraction of biomedical events from the BioNLP'09 shared task with a F1 score of 53.5% in development and 48.6% in testing.

In recent years, several biomedical event extraction (EE) systems have been developed. However, the nature of the annotated training corpora, as well as the training process itself, can limit the performance levels of the trained EE systems. In particular, most event-annotated corpora do not deal adequately with coreference. This impacts on the trained systems' ability to recognize biomedical entities, thus affecting their performance in extracting events accurately. Additionally, the fact that most EE systems are trained on a single annotated corpus further restricts their coverage. We have enhanced our existing EE system, EventMine, in two ways. First, we developed a new coreference resolution (CR) system and integrated it with EventMine. The standalone performance of our CR system in resolving anaphoric references to proteins is considerably higher than the best ranked system in the COREF subtask of the BioNLP'11 Shared Task. Secondly, the improved EventMine incorporates domain adaptation (DA) methods, which extend EE coverage by allowing several different annotated corpora to be used during training. Combined with a novel set of methods to increase the generality and efficiency of EventMine, the integration of both CR and DA have resulted in significant improvements in EE, ranging between 0.5% and 3.4% F-Score. The enhanced EventMine outperforms the highest ranked systems from the BioNLP'09 shared task, and from the GENIA and Infectious Diseases subtasks of the BioNLP'11 shared task.

The novel component of the architecture is a sequentially structured sentence classifier that identifies event-related story contexts. The sentence classifier uses lexical associations and discourse relations across sentences, as well as domain-specific distributions of candidate role fillers within and across sentences. This approach yields state-of-the-art performance on the MUC-4 data set, achieving substantially higher precision than previous systems.

Biomedical event extraction from articles as become a popular research topic driven by important applications, such as the automatic update of dedicated knowledge base. Most existing approaches are either pipeline models of specific classifiers, usually subject to cascading errors, or joint structured models, more efficient but also more costly and more involved to train. We propose here a system based on a pairwise model that transforms event extraction into a simple multi-class problem of classifying pairs of text entities. Such pairs are recursively provided to the classifier, so as to extract events involving other events as arguments. Our model is more direct than the usual pipeline approaches, and speeds up inference compared to joint models. We report here the best results reported so far on the BioNLP 2011 and 2013 Genia tasks.

Feature selection is of paramount importance for text-mining classifiers with high-dimensional features. The Turku Event Extraction System (TEES) is the best performing tool in the GENIA BioNLP 2009/2011 shared tasks, which relies heavily on high-dimensional features. This paper describes research which, based on an implementation of an accumulated effect evaluation (AEE) algorithm applying the greedy search strategy, analyses the contribution of every single feature class in TEES with a view to identify important features and modify the feature set accordingly. With an updated feature set, a new system is acquired with enhanced performance which achieves an increased -score of 53.27% up from 51.21% for Task 1 under strict evaluation criteria and 57.24% according to the approximate span and recursive criterion.

Several state-of-the-art event extraction systems employ models based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in a pipeline architecture, which fails to exploit the joint dependencies that typically exist among events and arguments. While there have been attempts to overcome this limitation using Markov  Logic  Networks  (MLNs),  it  remains challenging to perform joint inference in MLNs when the model encodes many high-dimensional sophisticated features such as those essential for event extraction.  In this paper, we propose a new model for event extraction that combines the power of MLNs and SVMs, dwarfing their limitations.  The key idea is to reliably learn and process high-dimensional features using SVMs;  encode the outputof SVMs as low-dimensional, soft formulas in MLNs; and use the superior joint inferencing power of MLNs to enforce joint consistency constraints over the soft formulas.  We evaluate our approach for the task  of  extracting  biomedical  events  onthe BioNLP 2013, 2011 and 2009 Geniashared task datasets. Our approach yields the best F1 score to date on the BioNLP’13 (53.61) and BioNLP’11 (58.07) datasets and the second-best F1 score to date on theBioNLP’09 dataset (58.16).

In this paper we propose a simple and yet effective Bayesian model, called Latent Event Model (LEM), to extract structured representation of events from social media.

Extracting biomedical event from literatures has attracted much attention recently. By now, most of the state-of-the-art systems have been based on pipelines which suffer from cascading errors, and the words encoded by one-hot are unable to represent the semantic information. Joint inference with dual decomposition and novel word embeddings are adopted to address the two problems, respectively, in this work. Word embeddings are learnt from large scale unlabeled texts and integrated as an unsupervised feature into other rich features based on dependency parse graphs to detect triggers and arguments. The proposed system consists of four components: trigger detector, argument detector, jointly inference with dual decomposition, and rule-based semantic post-processing, and outperforms the state-of-the-art systems. On the development set of BioNLP'09, the F-score is 59.77 percent on the primary task, which is 0.96 percent higher than the best system.

In this paper we propose a stacked generalization (or stacking) model for event extraction in bio-medical text. Event extraction deals with the process of extracting detailed biological phenomenon, which is more challenging compared to the traditional binary relation extraction such as protein-protein interaction. The overall process consists of mainly three steps: event trigger detection, argument extraction by edge detection and finding correct combination of arguments. In stacking, we use Linear Support Vector Classification (Linear SVC), Logistic Regression (LR) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as base-level learning algorithms. As meta-level learner we use Linear SVC. In edge detection step, we find out the arguments of triggers detected in trigger detection step using a SVM classifier. To find correct combination of arguments, we use rules generated by studying the properties of bio-molecular event expressions, and form an event expression consisting of event trigger, its class and arguments. The output of trigger detection is fed to edge detection for argument extraction. Experiments on benchmark datasets of BioNLP2011 show the recall, precision and Fscore of 48.96%, 66.46% and 56.38%, respectively. Comparisons with the existing systems show that our proposed model attains state-of-the-art performance.

Event extraction is a particularly challenging information extraction task, which intends to identify and classify event triggers and arguments from raw text. In recent works, when determining event types (trigger classification), most of the works are either pattern-only or feature-only. However, although patterns cannot cover all representations of an event, it is still a very important feature. In addition, when identifying and classifying arguments, previous works consider each candidate argument separately while ignoring the relationship between arguments. This paper proposes a Regularization-Based Pattern Balancing Method (RBPB). Inspired by the progress in representation learning, we use trigger embedding, sentence-level embedding and pattern features together as our features for trigger classification so that the effect of patterns and other useful features can be balanced. In addition, RBPB uses a regularization method to take advantage of the relationship between arguments. Experiments show that we achieve results better than current state-of-art equivalents.

To resolve this problem, we propose a feasible approach which encodes global information in the form of logic using Probabilistic Soft Logic model.

Most of the information is available in the form of unstructured textual documents due to the growth of information sources (the Web for example).

As a result, the Adaptive CRF approach (A-CRF) has shown good performance results. However, it requires a lot of expert intervention during the construction of classifiers, which is time consuming. To palpate such a downside, we introduce an approach that reduces the expert intervention during the relation extraction.

Event detection remains a challenge because of the difficulty of encoding the word semantics in various contexts. Previous approaches have heavily depended on language-specific knowledge and preexisting natural language processing tools. However, not all languages have such resources and tools available compared with English language. A more promising approach is to automatically learn effective features from data, without relying on language-specific resources. In this study, we develop a language-independent neural network to capture both sequence and chunk information from specific contexts and use them to train an event detector for multiple languages without any manually encoded features. Experiments show that our approach can achieve robust, efficient and accurate results for various languages. In the ACE 2005 English event detection task, our approach achieved a 73.4% F-score with an average of 3.0% absolute improvement compared with state-of-the-art. Additionally, our experimental results are competitive for Chinese and Spanish.

We conduct experiments with different configurations of type groups, and the experimental results show that information sharing among related event types remarkably improves the detecting performance.

This paper tackles the task of event detection, which involves identifying and categorizing events.

Considering local sentence context is insufficient to resolve ambiguities in identifying particular event types, therefore, we propose a novel document level Recurrent Neural Networks (DLRNN) model, which can automatically extract cross-sentence clues to improve sentence level event detection without designing complex reasoning rules.

The task of event detection involves identifying and categorizing event triggers. Contextual information has been shown effective on the task.

Meanwhile, dynamic memory network (DMN) has demonstrated promising capability in capturing contextual information and has been applied successfully to various tasks. In light of the multi-hop mechanism of the DMN to model the context, we propose the trigger detection dynamic memory network (TD-DMN) to tackle the event detection problem.

Neural network based models commonly regard event detection as a word-wise classification task, which suffer from the mismatch problem between words and event triggers, especially in languages without natural word delimiters such as Chinese. In this paper, we propose Nugget Proposal Networks (NPNs), which can solve the word-trigger mismatch problem by directly proposing entire trigger nuggets centered at each character regardless of word boundaries. Specifically, NPNs perform event detection in a character-wise paradigm, where a hybrid representation for each character is first learned to capture both structural and semantic information from both characters and words. Then based on learned representations, trigger nuggets are proposed and categorized by exploiting character compositional structures of Chinese event triggers. Experiments on both ACE2005 and TAC KBP 2017 datasets show that NPNs significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods.

Biomedical event extraction is important for medical research and disease prevention, which has attracted much attention in recent years. Traditionally, most of the state-of-the-art systems have been based on shallow machine learning methods, which require many complex, hand-designed features. In addition, the words encoded by one-hot are unable to represent semantic information. Therefore, we utilize dependency-based embeddings to represent words semantically and syntactically. Then, we propose a parallel multi-pooling convolutional neural network (PMCNN) model to capture the compositional semantic features of sentences. Furthermore, we employ a rectified linear unit, which creates sparse representations with true zeros, and which is adapted to the biomedical event extraction, as a nonlinear function in PMCNN architecture. The experimental results from MLEE dataset show that our approach achieves an F1 score of 80.27% in trigger identification and an F1 score of 59.65% in biomedical event extraction, which performs better than other state-of-the-art methods.

Event extraction plays an important role in natural language processing (NLP) applications including question answering and information retrieval. Traditional event extraction relies heavily on lexical and syntactic features, which require intensive human engineering and may not generalize to different datasets. Deep neural networks, on the other hand, are able to automatically learn underlying features, but existing networks do not make full use of syntactic relations. In this paper, we propose a novel dependency bridge recurrent neural network (dbRNN) for event extraction. We build our model upon a recurrent neural network, but enhance it with dependency bridges, which carry syntactically related information when modeling each word. We illustrates that simultaneously applying tree structure and sequence structure in RNN brings much better performance than only uses sequential RNN. In addition, we use a tensor layer to simultaneously capture the various types of latent interaction between candidate arguments as well as identify/classify all arguments of an event. Experiments show that our approach achieves competitive results compared with previous work.

Identifying event instance in text plays a critical role in building NLP applications such as Information Extraction (IE) system. However, most existing methods for this task focus only on monolingual clues of a specific language and ignore the massive information provided by other languages. Data scarcity and monolingual ambiguity hinder the performance of these monolingual approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel multilingual approach — dubbed as Gated MultiLingual Attention (GMLATT) framework — to address the two issues simultaneously. In specific, to alleviate data scarcity problem, we exploit the consistent information in multilingual data via context attention mechanism. Which takes advantage of the consistent evidence in multilingual data other than learning only from monolingual data. To deal with monolingual ambiguity problem, we propose gated cross-lingual attention to exploit the complement information conveyed by multilingual data, which is helpful for the disambiguation. The cross-lingual attention gate serves as a sentinel modelling the confidence of the clues provided by other languages and controls the information integration of various languages. We have conducted extensive experiments on the ACE 2005 benchmark. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Recently, end-to-end models based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) have gained great success in event detection. However these methods cannot deal with long-distance dependency and internal structure information well. They are also hard to be controlled in process of learning since lacking of prior knowledge integration. In this paper, we present an effective framework for event detection which aims to address these problems. Our model based on self-attention can ignore the distance between any two words to obtain their relationship and leverage internal event argument information to improve event detection. In order to control the process of learning, we first collect keywords from corpus and then use a prior knowledge integration network to encode keywords to a prior knowledge representation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model has significant improvement of 3.9 F1 over the previous state-of-the-art on ACE 2005 dataset.

In supervised event detection, most of the mislabeling occurs between a small number of confusing type pairs, including trigger-NIL pairs and sibling sub-types of the same coarse type. To address this label confusion problem, this paper proposes cost-sensitive regularization, which can force the training procedure to concentrate more on optimizing confusing type pairs. Specifically, we introduce a cost-weighted term into the training loss, which penalizes more on mislabeling between confusing label pairs. Furthermore, we also propose two estimators which can effectively measure such label confusion based on instance-level or population-level statistics. Experiments on TAC-KBP 2017 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve the performances of different models in both English and Chinese event detection.

Over the last few years, neural models for event extraction have obtained interesting results.

This representation is built following a bootstrapping approach by exploiting an intra-sentential convolutional model.

Motivation: Biomedical event detection is fundamental for information extraction in molecular biology and biomedical research. The detected events form the central basis for comprehensive biomedical knowledge fusion, facilitating the digestion of massive information influx from literature. Limited by the feature context, the existing event detection models are mostly applicable for a single task. A general and scalable computational model is desiderated for biomedical knowledge management. Results: We consider and propose a bottom-up detection framework to identify the events from recognized arguments. To capture the relations between the arguments, we trained a bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to model their context embedding. Leveraging the compositional attributes, we further derived the candidate samples for training event classifiers. We built our models on the datasets from BioNLP Shared Task for evaluations. Our method achieved the average F-scores of 0.81 and 0.92 on BioNLPST-BGI and BioNLPST-BB datasets respectively. Comparing with 7 state-of-the-art methods, our method nearly doubled the existing F-score performance (0.92 vs 0.56) on the BioNLPST-BB dataset.

The ambiguity in language expressions poses a great challenge for event detection. To disambiguate event types, current approaches rely on external NLP toolkits to build knowledge representations. Unfortunately, these approaches work in a pipeline paradigm and suffer from error propagation problem. In this paper, we propose an adversarial imitation based knowledge distillation approach, for the first time, to tackle the challenge of acquiring knowledge from rawsentences for event detection. In our approach, a teacher module is first devised to learn the knowledge representations from the ground-truth annotations. Then, we set up a student module that only takes the raw-sentences as the input. The student module is taught to imitate the behavior of the teacher under the guidance of an adversarial discriminator. By this way, the process of knowledge distillation from rawsentence has been implicitly integrated into the feature encoding stage of the student module. To the end, the enhanced student is used for event detection, which processes raw texts and requires no extra toolkits, naturally eliminating the error propagation problem faced by pipeline approaches. We conduct extensive experiments on the ACE 2005 datasets, and the experimental results justify the effectiveness of our approach.

Classical event encoding and extraction methods rely on fixed dictionaries of keywords and templates or require ground truth labels for phrase/sentences. This hinders widespread application of information encoding approaches to large-scale free form (unstructured) text available on the web. Event encoding can be viewed as a hierarchical task where the coarser level task is event detection, i.e., identification of documents containing a specific event, and where the fine-grained task is one of event encoding, i.e., identifying key phrases, key sentences. Hierarchical models with attention seem like a natural choice for this problem, given their ability to differentially attend to more or less important features when constructing document representations. In this work we present a novel factorized bilinear multi-aspect attention mechanism (FBMA) that attends to different aspects of text while constructing its representation. We find that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for detecting civil unrest, military action, and non-state actor events from corpora in two different languages.

Sentence-level event detection (ED) is a task ofdetecting words that describe specific types of events, in-cluding the subtasks of trigger word identification and eventtype classification. Previous work straight forwardly inputs asentence into neural classification models and analyzes deepsemantics of words in the sentence one by one. Relying on the semantics, probabilities of event classes can be predicted foreach word, including the carefully defined ACE event classesand a ”N/A” class(i.e., non-trigger word). The models achieve remarkable successes nowadays. However, our findings show that a natural sentence may posses more than one trigger word and thus entail different types of events. In particular,the closely related information of each event only lies in a unique sentence segment but has nothing to do with other segments. In order to reduce negative influences from noises in other segments, we propose to perform semantics learning for event detection only in the scope of segment instead of the whole sentence. Accordingly, we develop a novel ED method which integrates sentence segmentation into the neural event classification architecture. Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) with multi-head attention is used as the classification model. Sentence segmentation is boiled down to a sequence labeling problem, where BERT is used. We combine embeddings, and use them as the input of the neural classification model. The experimental results show that the performance of our method reaches 76.8% and 74.2% F1-scores for trigger identification and event type classification, which outperforms the state-of-the-art

To extract the structured representations of open-domain events, Bayesian graphical models have made some progress. However, these approaches typically assume that all words in a document are generated from a single event. While this may be true for short text such as tweets, such an assumption does not generally hold for long text such as news articles. Moreover, Bayesian graphical models often rely on Gibbs sampling for parameter inference which may take long time to converge. To address these limitations, we propose an event extraction model based on Generative Adversarial Nets, called Adversarial-neural Event Model (AEM). AEM models an event with a Dirichlet prior and uses a generator network to capture the patterns underlying latent events. A discriminator is used to distinguish documents reconstructed from the latent events and the original documents. A byproduct of the discriminator is that the features generated by the learned discriminator network allow the visualization of the extracted events. Our model has been evaluated on two Twitter datasets and a news article dataset. Experimental results show that our model outperforms the baseline approaches on all the datasets, with more significant improvements observed on the news article dataset where an increase of 15\% is observed in F-measure.

The identification of complex semantic structures such as events and entity relations, already a challenging Information Extraction task, is doubly difficult from sources written in under-resourced and under-annotated languages. We investigate the suitability of cross-lingual structure transfer techniques for these tasks. We exploit relation and event-relevant language-universal features, leveraging both symbolic (including part-of-speech and dependency path) and distributional (including type representation and contextualized representation) information. By representing all entity mentions, event triggers, and contexts into this complex and structured multilingual common space, using graph convolutional networks, we can train a relation or event extractor from source language annotations and apply it to the target language. Extensive experiments on cross-lingual relation and event transfer among English, Chinese, and Arabic demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art supervised models trained on up to 3,000 manually annotated mentions: up to 62.6% F-score for Relation Extraction, and 63.1% F-score for Event Argument Role Labeling. The event argument role labeling model transferred from English to Chinese achieves similar performance as the model trained from Chinese. We thus find that language-universal symbolic and distributional representations are complementary for cross-lingual structure transfer.

Event detection (ED) aims to locate trigger words in raw text and then classify them into correct event types. In this task, neural net- work based models became mainstream in recent years. However, two problems arise when it comes to languages without natural delimiters, such as Chinese. First, word-based models severely suffer from the problem of word trigger mismatch, limiting the performance of the methods. In addition, even if trigger words could be accurately located, the ambiguity of polysemy of triggers could still affect the trigger classification stage. To address the two issues simultaneously, we propose the Trigger-aware Lattice Neural Net- work (TLNN).

We propose a Dynamic-Memory-Based Prototypical Network (DMB-PN), which exploits Dynamic Memory Network (DMN) to not only learn better prototypes for event types, but also produce more robust sentence encodings for event mentions. Differing from vanilla prototypical networks simply computing event prototypes by averaging, which only consume event mentions once, our model is more robust and is capable of distilling contextual information from event mentions for multiple times due to the multi-hop mechanism of DMNs. The experiments show that DMB-PN not only deals with sample scarcity better than a series of baseline models but also performs more robustly when the variety of event types is relatively large and the instance quantity is extremely small.

Event detection (ED), a key subtask of information extraction, aims to recognize instances of specific types of events in text. Recently, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) over dependency trees have been widely used to capture syntactic structure information and get convincing performances in event detection. However, these works ignore the syntactic relation labels on the tree, which convey rich and useful linguistic knowledge for event detection. In this paper, we investigate a novel architecture named Relation-Aware GCN (RA-GCN), which efficiently exploits syntactic relation labels and models the relation between words specifically. We first propose a relation-aware aggregation module to produce expressive word representation by aggregating syntactically connected words through specific relation. Furthermore, a context-aware relation update module is designed to explicitly update the relation representation between words, and these two modules work in the mutual promotion way. Experimental results on the ACE2005 dataset show that our model achieves a new state-of-the-art performance for event detection.

Background

Biomedical event extraction is a fundamental and in-demand technology that has attracted substantial interest from many researchers. Previous works have heavily relied on manual designed features and external NLP packages in which the feature engineering is large and complex. Additionally, most of the existing works use the pipeline process that breaks down a task into simple sub-tasks but ignores the interaction between them. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel event combination strategy based on hybrid deep neural networks to settle the task in a joint end-to-end manner.

Results

We adapted our method to several annotated corpora of biomedical event extraction tasks. Our method achieved state-of-the-art performance with noticeable overall F1 score improvement compared to that of existing methods for all of these corpora.

Conclusions

The experimental results demonstrated that our method is effective for biomedical event extraction. The combination strategy can reconstruct complex events from the output of deep neural networks, while the deep neural networks effectively capture the feature representation from the raw text. The biomedical event extraction implementation is available online at http://www.predictor.xin/event_extraction.

Biomedical event extraction is a crucial task in order to automatically extract information from the increasingly growing body of biomedical literature. Despite advances in the methods in recent years, most event extraction systems are still evaluated in-domain and on complete event structures only. This makes it hard to determine the performance of intermediate stages of the task, such as edge detection, across different corpora. Motivated by these limitations, we present the first cross-domain study of edge detection for biomedical event extraction. We analyze differences between five existing gold standard corpora, create a standardized benchmark corpus, and provide a strong baseline model for edge detection. Experiments show a large drop in performance when the baseline is applied on out-of-domain data, confirming the need for domain adaptation methods for the task. To encourage research efforts in this direction, we make both the data and the baseline available to the research community: https://www.cosbi.eu/cfx/9985.

Most of the current cross-lingual transfer learning methods for Information Extraction (IE) have been only applied to name tagging. To tackle more complex tasks such as event extraction we need to transfer graph structures (event trigger linked to multiple arguments with various roles) across languages. We develop a novel share-and-transfer framework to reach this goal with three steps: (1) Convert each sentence in any language to language-universal graph structures; in this paper we explore two approaches based on universal dependency parses and complete graphs, respectively. (2) Represent each node in the graph structure with a cross-lingual word embedding so that all sentences in multiple languages can be represented with one shared semantic space. (3) Using this common semantic space, train event extractors from English training data and apply them to languages that do not have any event annotations. Experimental results on three languages (Spanish, Russian and Ukrainian) without any annotations show this framework achieves comparable performance to a state-of-the-art supervised model trained from more than 1,500 manually annotated event mentions.

The problem of event extraction requires detecting the event trigger and extracting its corresponding arguments. Existing work in event argument extraction typically relies heavily on entity recognition as a preprocessing/concurrent step, causing the well-known problem of error propagation. To avoid this issue, we introduce a new paradigm for event extraction by formulating it as a question answering (QA) task, which extracts the event arguments in an end-to-end manner. Empirical results demonstrate that our framework outperforms prior methods substantially; in addition, it is capable of extracting event arguments for roles not seen at training time (zero-shot learning setting).

Automatically analyzing events in a large amount of text is crucial for situation awareness and decision making. Previous approaches treat event extraction as “one size fits all” with an ontology defined a priori. The resulted extraction models are built just for extracting those types in the ontology. These approaches cannot be easily adapted to new event types nor new domains of interest. To accommodate personalized event-centric information needs, this paper introduces the few-shot Event Mention Retrieval (EMR) task: given a user-supplied query consisting of a handful of event mentions, return relevant event mentions found in a corpus. This formulation enables “query by example”, which drastically lowers the bar of specifying event-centric information needs. The retrieval setting also enables fuzzy search. We present an evaluation framework leveraging existing event datasets such as ACE. We also develop a Siamese Network approach, and show that it performs better than ad-hoc retrieval models in the few-shot EMR setting.

Evaluated on the recent RAMS dataset (Ebner et al., 2020), our model achieves overall better performance than a strong sequence labeling baseline. We further provide detailed error analysis, presenting where the model mainly makes errors and indicating directions for future improvements. It remains a challenge to detect implicit arguments, calling for more future work of document-level modeling for this task.

Few works in the literature of event extraction have gone beyond individual sentences to make extraction decisions. This is problematic when the information needed to recognize an event argument is spread across multiple sentences. We argue that document-level event extraction is a difficult task since it requires a view of a larger context to determine which spans of text correspond to event role fillers. We first investigate how end-to-end neural sequence models (with pre-trained language model representations) perform on document-level role filler extraction, as well as how the length of context captured affects the models’ performance. To dynamically aggregate information captured by neural representations learned at different levels of granularity (e.g., the sentence- and paragraph-level), we propose a novel multi-granularity reader. We evaluate our models on the MUC-4 event extraction dataset, and show that our best system performs substantially better than prior work. We also report findings on the relationship between context length and neural model performance on the task.

Due to the exponential growth of biomedical literature, event and relation extraction are important tasks in biomedical text mining. Most work only focus on relation extraction, and detect a single entity pair mention on a short span of text, which is not ideal due to long sentences that appear in biomedical contexts. We propose an approach to both relation and event extraction, for simultaneously predicting relationships between all mention pairs in a text. We also perform an empirical study to discuss different network setups for this purpose. The best performing model includes a set of multi-head attentions and convolutions, an adaptation of the transformer architecture, which offers self-attention the ability to strengthen dependencies among related elements, and models the interaction between features extracted by multiple attention heads. Experiment results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state of the art on a set of benchmark biomedical corpora including BioNLP 2009, 2011, 2013 and BioCreative 2017 shared tasks.

We evaluate the proposed approach on three biomedical events and show that the decoder generates interpretable rules that serve as accurate explanations for the event classifier’s decisions, and, importantly, that the joint training generally improves the performance of the event classifier.

Event detection is a crucial and challenging sub-task of event extraction, which suffers from a severe ambiguity issue of trigger words.

In this paper, we first contribute an image dataset supplement to ED benchmarks (i.e., ACE2005) for training and evaluation. We then propose a novel Dual Recurrent Multimodal Model, DRMM, to conduct deep interactions between images and sentences for modality features aggregation. DRMM utilizes pre-trained BERT and ResNet to encode sentences and images, and employs an alternating dual attention to select informative features for mutual enhancements.

Event detection (ED), a sub-task of event extraction, involves identifying triggers and categorizing event mentions.

In this paper, we consider and reformulate the ED task with limited labeled data as a Few-Shot Learning problem. We propose a Dynamic-Memory-Based Prototypical Network (DMB-PN), which exploits Dynamic Memory Network (DMN) to not only learn better prototypes for event types, but also produce more robust sentence encodings for event mentions. Differing from vanilla prototypical networks simply computing event prototypes by averaging, which only consume event mentions once, our model is more robust and is capable of distilling contextual information from event mentions for multiple times due to the multi-hop mechanism of DMNs. The experiments show that DMB-PN not only deals with sample scarcity better than a series of baseline models but also performs more robustly when the variety of event types is relatively large and the instance quantity is extremely small.

The share prices of listed companies in the stock trading market are prone to be influenced by various events. Performing event detection could help people to timely identify investment risks and opportunities accompanying these events. The financial events inherently present hierarchical structures, which could be represented as tree-structured schemes in real-life applications, and detecting events could be modeled as a hierarchical multi-label text classification problem, where an event is designated to a tree node with a sequence of hierarchical event category labels. Conventional hierarchical multi-label text classification methods usually ignore the hierarchical relationships existing in the event classification scheme, and treat the hierarchical labels associated with an event as uniform labels, where correct or wrong label predictions are assigned with equal rewards or penalties. In this paper, we propose a neural hierarchical multi-label text classification method, namely F-HMTC, for a financial application scenario with massive event category labels. F-HMTC learns the latent features based on bidirectional encoder representations from transformers, and directly maps them to hierarchical labels with a delicate hierarchy-based loss layer. We conduct extensive experiments on a private financial dataset with elaborately-annotated labels, and F-HMTC consistently outperforms state-of-art baselines by substantial margins.

We then introduce Path Language Model, an auto-regressive language model trained on event-event paths, and select salient and coherent paths to probabilistically construct these graph schemas. We design two evaluation metrics, instance coverage and instance coherence, to evaluate the quality of graph schema induction, by checking when coherent event instances are covered by the schema graph. Intrinsic evaluations show that our approach is highly effective at inducing salient and coherent schemas. Extrinsic evaluations show the induced schema repository provides significant improvement to downstream end-to-end Information Extraction over a state-of-the-art joint neural extraction model, when used as additional global features to unfold instance graphs.

Extracting event temporal relations is a critical task for information extraction and plays an important role in natural language understanding. Prior systems leverage deep learning and pre-trained language models to improve the performance of the task. However, these systems often suffer from two short-comings: 1) when performing maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference based on neural models, previous systems only used structured knowledge that are assumed to be absolutely correct, i.e., hard constraints; 2) biased predictions on dominant temporal relations when training with a limited amount of data. To address these issues, we propose a framework that enhances deep neural network with distributional constraints constructed by probabilistic domain knowledge. We solve the constrained inference problem via Lagrangian Relaxation and apply it on end-to-end event temporal relation extraction tasks. Experimental results show our framework is able to improve the baseline neural network models with strong statistical significance on two widely used datasets in news and clinical domains.

Event extraction (EE) is a crucial information extraction task that aims to extract event information in texts. Previous methods for EE typically model it as a classification task, which are usually prone to the data scarcity problem. In this paper, we propose a new learning paradigm of EE, by explicitly casting it as a machine reading comprehension problem (MRC). Our approach includes an unsupervised question generation process, which can transfer event schema into a set of natural questions, followed by a BERT-based question-answering process to retrieve answers as EE results. This learning paradigm enables us to strengthen the reasoning process of EE, by introducing sophisticated models in MRC, and relieve the data scarcity problem, by introducing the large-scale datasets in MRC. The empirical results show that: i) our approach attains state-of-the-art performance by considerable margins over previous methods. ii) Our model is excelled in the data-scarce scenario, for example, obtaining 49.8% in F1 for event argument extraction with only 1% data, compared with 2.2% of the previous method. iii) Our model also fits with zero-shot scenarios, achieving 37.0% and 16% in F1 on two datasets without using any EE training data.

Conventional approaches to event detection usually require a fixed set of pre-defined event types. Such a requirement is often challenged in real-world applications, as new events continually occur. Due to huge computation cost and storage budge, it is infeasible to store all previous data and re-train the model with all previous data and new data, every time new events arrive. We formulate such challenging scenarios as incremental event detection, which requires a model to learn new classes incrementally without performance degradation on previous classes. However, existing incremental learning methods cannot handle semantic ambiguity and training data imbalance problems between old and new classes in the task of incremental event detection. In this paper, we propose a Knowledge Consolidation Network (KCN) to address the above issues. Specifically, we devise two components, prototype enhanced retrospection and hierarchical distillation, to mitigate the adverse effects of semantic ambiguity and class imbalance, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, outperforming the state-of-the-art model by 19% and 13.4% of whole F1 score on ACE benchmark and TAC KBP benchmark, respectively.

Recent studies on event detection (ED) have shown that the syntactic dependency graph can be employed in graph convolution neural networks (GCN) to achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, the computation of the hidden vectors in such graph-based models is agnostic to the trigger candidate words, potentially leaving irrelevant information for the trigger candidate for event prediction. In addition, the current models for ED fail to exploit the overall contextual importance scores of the words, which can be obtained via the dependency tree, to boost the performance. In this study, we propose a novel gating mechanism to filter noisy information in the hidden vectors of the GCN models for ED based on the information from the trigger candidate. We also introduce novel mechanisms to achieve the contextual diversity for the gates and the importance score consistency for the graphs and models in ED. The experiments show that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two ED datasets.

In this paper, we propose a novel architecture named Edge-Enhanced Graph Convolution Networks (EE-GCN), which simultaneously exploits syntactic structure and typed dependency label information to perform ED. Specifically, an edge-aware node update module is designed to generate expressive word representations by aggregating syntactically-connected words through specific dependency types. Furthermore, to fully explore clues hidden from dependency edges, a node-aware edge update module is introduced, which refines the relation representations with contextual information.These two modules are complementary to each other and work in a mutual promotion way. We conduct experiments on the widely used ACE2005 dataset and the results show significant improvement over competitive baseline methods.

Event extraction, which aims to identify event triggers of pre-defined event types and their arguments of specific roles, is a challenging task in NLP. Most traditional approaches formulate this task as classification problems, with event types or argument roles taken as golden labels. Such approaches fail to model rich interactions among event types and arguments of different roles, and cannot generalize to new types or roles. This work proposes a new paradigm that formulates event extraction as multi-turn question answering. Our approach, MQAEE, casts the extraction task into a series of reading comprehension problems, by which it extracts triggers and arguments successively from a given sentence. A history answer embedding strategy is further adopted to model question answering history in the multi-turn process. By this new formulation, MQAEE makes full use of dependency among arguments and event types, and generalizes well to new types with new argument roles. Empirical results on ACE 2005 shows that MQAEE outperforms current state-of-the-art, pushing the final F1 of argument extraction to 53.4% (+2.0%). And it also has a good generalization ability, achieving competitive performance on 13 new event types even if trained only with a few samples of them.

Event detection (ED) aims to identify and classify event triggers in texts, which is a crucial subtask of event extraction (EE). Despite many advances in ED, the existing studies are typically centered on improving the overall performance of an ED model, which rarely consider the robustness of an ED model. This paper aims to fill this research gap by stressing the importance of robustness modeling in ED models. We first pinpoint three stark cases demonstrating the brittleness of the existing ED models. After analyzing the underlying reason, we propose a new training mechanism, called context-selective mask generalization for ED, which can effectively mine context-specific patterns for learning and robustify an ED model. The experimental results have confirmed the effectiveness of our model regarding defending against adversarial attacks, exploring unseen predicates, and tackling ambiguity cases. Moreover, a deeper analysis suggests that our approach can learn a complementary predictive bias with most ED models that use full context for feature learning.

Consequently, in this work, we propose a novel model for EAE that exploits both syntactic and semantic structures of the sentences with the Graph Transformer Networks (GTNs) to learn more effective sentence structures for EAE.

Using the attention map based probing frame-work from (Clark et al., 2019), we observe that, on the RAMS dataset (Ebner et al., 2020), BERT's attention heads have modest but well above-chance ability to spot event arguments sans any training or domain finetuning, vary-ing from a low of 17.77% for Place to a high of 51.61% for Artifact. Next, we find that linear combinations of these heads, estimated with approx 11% of available total event argument detection supervision, can push performance well-higher for some roles - highest two being Victim (68.29% Accuracy) and Artifact(58.82% Accuracy). Furthermore, we investigate how well our methods do for cross-sentence event arguments. We propose a procedure to isolate "best heads" for cross-sentence argument detection separately of those for intra-sentence arguments. The heads thus estimated have superior cross-sentence performance compared to their jointly estimated equivalents, albeit only under the unrealistic assumption that we already know the argument is present in an-other sentence. Lastly, we seek to isolate to what extent our numbers stem from lexical frequency based associations between gold arguments and roles. We propose NONCE, a scheme to create adversarial test examples by replacing gold arguments with randomly generated "nonce" words. We find that learnt linear combinations are robust to NONCE, though individual best heads can be more sensitive.

Using Chinese event extraction as a case study and bitexts as a new source of information, we present three bootstrapping techniques. We first conclude that the standard mono-lingual bootstrapping approach is not so effective. Then we exploit a second approach that potentially benefits from the extra information captured by an English event extraction system and projected into Chinese. Such a cross-lingual scheme produces significant performance gain. Finally we show that the combination of mono-lingual and cross-lingual information in bootstrapping can further enhance the performance. Ultimately this new framework obtained 10.1% relative improvement in trigger labeling (F-measure) and 9.5% relative improvement in argument-labeling.

Background

Biomedical extraction based on supervised machine learning still faces the problem that a limited labeled dataset does not saturate the learning method. Many supervised learning algorithms for bio-event extraction have been affected by the data sparseness. 

Methods

In this study, a semi-supervised method for combining labeled data with large scale of unlabeled data is presented to improve the performance of biomedical event extraction. We propose a set of rich feature vector, including a variety of syntactic features and semantic features, such as N-gram features, walk subsequence features, predicate argument structure (PAS) features, especially some new features derived from a strategy named Event Feature Coupling Generalization (EFCG). The EFCG algorithm can create useful event recognition features by making use of the correlation between two sorts of original features explored from the labeled data, while the correlation is computed with the help of massive amounts of unlabeled data. This introduced EFCG approach aims to solve the data sparse problem caused by limited tagging corpus, and enables the new features to cover much more event related information with better generalization properties. 

Results

The effectiveness of our event extraction system is evaluated on the datasets from the BioNLP Shared Task 2011 and PubMed. Experimental results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance in the fine-grained biomedical information extraction task. 

Conclusions

Limited labeled data could be combined with unlabeled data to tackle the data sparseness problem by means of our EFCG approach, and the classified capability of the model was enhanced through establishing a rich feature set by both labeled and unlabeled datasets. So this semi-supervised learning approach could go far towards improving the performance of the event extraction system. To the best of our knowledge, it was the first attempt at combining labeled and unlabeled data for tasks related biomedical event extraction.

Background

Biomedical events are key to understanding physiological processes and disease, and wide coverage extraction is required for comprehensive automatic analysis of statements describing biomedical systems in the literature. In turn, the training and evaluation of extraction methods requires manually annotated corpora. However, as manual annotation is time-consuming and expensive, any single event-annotated corpus can only cover a limited number of semantic types. Although combined use of several such corpora could potentially allow an extraction system to achieve broad semantic coverage, there has been little research into learning from multiple corpora with partially overlapping semantic annotation scopes.

Results

We propose a method for learning from multiple corpora with partial semantic annotation overlap, and implement this method to improve our existing event extraction system, EventMine. An evaluation using seven event annotated corpora, including 65 event types in total, shows that learning from overlapping corpora can produce a single, corpus-independent, wide coverage extraction system that outperforms systems trained on single corpora and exceeds previously reported results on two established event extraction tasks from the BioNLP Shared Task 2011.

Conclusions

The proposed method allows the training of a wide-coverage, state-of-the-art event extraction system from multiple corpora with partial semantic annotation overlap. The resulting single model makes broad-coverage extraction straightforward in practice by removing the need to either select a subset of compatible corpora or semantic types, or to merge results from several models trained on different individual corpora. Multi-corpus learning also allows annotation efforts to focus on covering additional semantic types, rather than aiming for exhaustive coverage in any single annotation effort, or extending the coverage of semantic types annotated in existing corpora.

An important aspect of natural language understanding involves recognizing and categorizing events and the relations among them. However, these tasks are quite subtle and annotating training data for machine learning based approaches is an expensive task, resulting in supervised systems that attempt to learn complex models from small amounts of data, which they over-fit. This paper addresses this challenge by developing an event detection and co-reference system with minimal supervision, in the form of a few event examples. We view these tasks as semantic similarity problems between event mentions or event mentions and an ontology of types, thus facilitating the use of large amounts of out of domain text data. Notably, our semantic relatedness function exploits the structure of the text by making use of a semantic-role-labeling based representation of an event. We show that our approach to event detection is competitive with the top supervised methods.

Frames defined in FrameNet (FN) share highly similar structures with events in ACE event extraction program. An event in ACE is composed of an event trigger and a set of arguments. Analogously, a frame in FN is composed of a lexical unit and a set of frame elements, which play similar roles as triggers and arguments of ACE events respectively. Besides having similar structures, many frames in FN actually express certain types of events. The above observations motivate us to explore whether there exists a good mapping from frames to event-types and if it is possible to improve event detection by using FN. In this paper, we propose a global inference approach to detect events in FN. Further, based on the detected results, we analyze possible mappings from frames to event-types. Finally, we improve the performance of event detection and achieve a new state-of-the-art result by using the events automatically detected from FN.

Adverse drug events (ADEs) are medical complications co-occurring with a period of drug usage. Identiﬁcation of ADEs is a primary way of evaluating available quality of care. As more social media users begin discussing their drug experiences online, public data becomes available for researchers to expand existing electronic ADE reporting systems, though non-standard language inhibits ease of analysis. In this study, portions of a new corpus of approximately 160,000 tweets were used to create a lexicon-driven ADE detection system using semi-supervised, pattern-based bootstrapping. This method was able to identify misspellings, slang terms, and other non-standard language features of social media data to drive a competitive ADE detection system.

Modern models of event extraction for tasks like ACE are based on supervised learning of events from small hand-labeled data. However, hand-labeled training data is expensive to produce, in low coverage of event types, and limited in size, which makes supervised methods hard to extract large scale of events for knowledge base population. To solve the data labeling problem, we propose to automatically label training data for event extraction via world knowledge and linguistic knowledge, which can detect key arguments and trigger words for each event type and employ them to label events in texts automatically. The experimental results show that the quality of our large scale automatically labeled data is competitive with elaborately human-labeled data. And our automatically labeled data can incorporate with human-labeled data, then improve the performance of models learned from these data.

The task of event extraction has long been investigated in a supervised learning paradigm, which is bound by the number and the quality of the training instances. Existing training data must be manually generated through a combination of expert domain knowledge and extensive human involvement. However, due to drastic efforts required in annotating text, the resultant datasets are usually small, which severally affects the quality of the learned model, making it hard to generalize. Our work develops an automatic approach for generating training data for event extraction. Our approach allows us to scale up event extraction training instances from thousands to hundreds of thousands, and it does this at a much lower cost than a manual approach. We achieve this by employing distant supervision to automatically create event annotations from unlabelled text using existing structured knowledge bases or tables.We then develop a neural network model with post inference to transfer the knowledge extracted from structured knowledge bases to automatically annotate typed events with corresponding arguments in text.We evaluate our approach by using the knowledge extracted from Freebase to label texts from Wikipedia articles. Experimental results show that our approach can generate a large number of high quality training instances. We show that this large volume of training data not only leads to a better event extractor, but also allows us to detect multiple typed events.

Most previous supervised event extraction methods have relied on features derived from manual annotations, and thus cannot be applied to new event types without extra annotation effort. We take a fresh look at event extraction and model it as a generic grounding problem: mapping each event mention to a specific type in a target event ontology. We design a transferable architecture of structural and compositional neural networks to jointly represent and map event mentions and types into a shared semantic space. Based on this new framework, we can select, for each event mention, the event type which is semantically closest in this space as its type. By leveraging manual annotations available for a small set of existing event types, our framework can be applied to new unseen event types without additional manual annotations. When tested on 23 unseen event types, our zero-shot framework, without manual annotations, achieved performance comparable to a supervised model trained from 3,000 sentences annotated with 500 event mentions.

Modern weakly supervised methods for event detection (ED) avoid time-consuming human annotation and achieve promising results by learning from auto-labeled data. However, these methods typically rely on sophisticated pre-defined rules as well as existing instances in knowledge bases for automatic annotation and thus suffer from low coverage, topic bias, and data noise. To address these issues, we build a large event-related candidate set with good coverage and then apply an adversarial training mechanism to iteratively identify those informative instances from the candidate set and filter out those noisy ones. The experiments on two real-world datasets show that our candidate selection and adversarial training can cooperate together to obtain more diverse and accurate training data for ED, and significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods in various weakly supervised scenarios.

Event extraction is useful for many practical applications, such as news summarization and information retrieval. However, the popular automatic context extraction (ACE) event extraction program only defines very limited and coarse event schemas, which may not be suitable for practical applications. FrameNet is a linguistic corpus that defines complete semantic frames and frame-to-frame relations. As frames in FrameNet share highly similar structures with event schemas in ACE and many frames actually express events, we propose to redefine the event schemas based on FrameNet. Specifically, we extract frames expressing event information from FrameNet and leverage the frame-to-frame relations to build a hierarchy of event schemas that are more fine-grained and have much wider coverage than ACE. Based on the new event schemas, we propose a joint event extraction approach that leverages the hierarchical structure of event schemas and frame-to-frame relations in FrameNet. The extensive experiments have verified the advantages of our hierarchical event schemas and the effectiveness of our event extraction model. We further apply the results of our event extraction model on news summarization. The results show that the summarization approach based on our event extraction model achieves significant better performance than several state-of-the-art summarization approaches, which also demonstrates that the hierarchical event schemas and event extraction model are promising to be used in the practical applications.

Most existing event extraction (EE) methods merely extract event arguments within the sentence scope. However, such sentence-level EE methods struggle to handle soaring amounts of documents from emerging applications, such as finance, legislation, health, etc., where event arguments always scatter across different sentences, and even multiple such event mentions frequently co-exist in the same document. To address these challenges, we propose a novel end-to-end model, Doc2EDAG, which can generate an entity-based directed acyclic graph to fulfill the document-level EE (DEE) effectively. Moreover, we reformalize a DEE task with the no-trigger-words design to ease the document-level event labeling. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Doc2EDAG, we build a large-scale real-world dataset consisting of Chinese financial announcements with the challenges mentioned above. Extensive experiments with comprehensive analyses illustrate the superiority of Doc2EDAG over state-of-the-art methods. Data and codes can be found at this https URL.

Subevents elaborate an event and widely exist in event descriptions. Subevent knowledge is useful for discourse analysis and event-centric applications. Acknowledging the scarcity of subevent knowledge, we propose a weakly supervised approach to extract subevent relation tuples from text and build the first large scale subevent knowledge base. We first obtain the initial set of event pairs that are likely to have the subevent relation, by exploiting two observations that 1) subevents are temporally contained by the parent event, and 2) the definitions of the parent event can be used to further guide the identification of subevents. Then, we collect rich weak supervision using the initial seed subevent pairs to train a contextual classifier using BERT and apply the classifier to identify new subevent pairs. The evaluation showed that the acquired subevent tuples (239K) are of high quality (90.1% accuracy) and cover a wide range of event types.

Retrospective news event detection (RED) is defined as the discovery of previously unidentified events in historical news corpus. Although both the contents and time information of news articles are helpful to RED, most researches focus on the utilization of the contents of news articles. Few research works have been carried out on finding better usages of time information. In this paper, we do some explorations on both directions based on the following two characteristics of news articles. On the one hand, news articles are always aroused by events; on the other hand, similar articles reporting the same event often redundantly appear on many news sources. The former hints a generative model of news articles, and the latter provides data enriched environments to perform RED. With consideration of these characteristics, we propose a probabilistic model to incorporate both content and time information in a unified framework. This model gives new representations of both news articles and news events. Furthermore, based on this approach, we build an interactive RED system, HISCOVERY, which provides additional functions to present events, Photo Story and Chronicle.

 In this work, we attempt to capture the rich structure of events and their dependencies in a news topic through our event models. We call the process of recognizing events and their dependencies <i>event threading</i>. We believe our perspective of modeling the structure of a topic is more effective in capturing its semantics than a flat list of on-topic stories.
 We formally define the novel problem, suggest evaluation metrics and present a few techniques for solving the problem. Besides the standard word based features, our approaches take into account novel features such as temporal locality of stories for event recognition and time-ordering for capturing dependencies.

Most research in the field of anaphora or coreference detection has been limited to noun phrase coreference, usually on a restricted set of entities, such as ACE entities. In part, this has been due to the lack of corpus resources tagged with general anaphoric coreference. The OntoNotes project is creating a large-scale, accurate corpus for general anaphoric coreference that covers entities and events not limited to noun phrases or a limited set of entity types. The coreference layer in OntoNotes constitutes one part of a multi-layer, integrated annotation of shallow semantic structure in text. This paper presents an initial model for unrestricted coreference based on this data that uses a machine learning architecture with state-of-the-art features. Significant improvements can be expected from using such cross-layer information for training predictive models. This paper describes the coreference annotation in OntoNotes, presents the baseline model, and provides an analysis of the contribution of this new resource in the context of recent MUC and ACE results.

In this paper, we present a linguistic resource that annotates event structures in texts. We consider an event structure as a collection of events that interact with each other in a given situation. We interpret the inter actions between events as event relations. In this regard, we propose and annotate a set of six relations that best capture the concep t of event structure. These relations are: subevent, reason, purpose, enablement, precedence and related. A document from this resource can encode multiple event structures and an event structure can be described across multiple documents. In order to unify event structures, we also annotate inter- and intra-document event coreference. Moreover, we provide methodologies for automatic discovery of event structures from texts. First, we group the events that constitute an event structure into event clusters and then, we use supervised lear ning frameworks to classify the relations that exist between events from the same cluster.

Event coreference is an important and complicated task in cascaded event template extraction and other natural language processing tasks. Despite its importance, it was merely discussed in previous studies. In this paper, we present a globally optimized coreference resolution system dedicated to various sophisticated event coreference phenomena. Seven resolvers for both event and object coreference cases are utilized, which include three new resolvers for event coreference resolution. Three enhancements are further proposed at both mention pair detection and chain formation levels. First, the object coreference resolvers are used to effectively reduce the false positive cases for event coreference. Second, A revised instance selection scheme is proposed to improve link level mention-pair model performances. Last but not least, an efficient and glo-bally optimized graph partitioning model is employed for coreference chain formation using spectral partitioning which allows the incorporation of pronoun coreference information. The three techniques contribute to a significant improvement of 8.54% in B 3 F-score for event co-reference resolution on OntoNotes 2.0 corpus.

We introduce a novel coreference resolution system that models entities and events jointly. Our iterative method cautiously constructs clusters of entity and event mentions using linear regression to model cluster merge operations. As clusters are built, information flows between entity and event clusters through features that model semantic role dependencies. Our system handles nominal and verbal events as well as entities, and our joint formulation allows information from event coreference to help entity coreference, and vice versa. In a cross-document domain with comparable documents, joint coreference resolution performs significantly better (over 3 CoNLL F1 points) than two strong baselines that resolve entities and events separately.

Event co-reference is the process of identifying descriptions of the same event across sentences, documents, or structured databases.

A dynamic weighting approach is taken to combine the three similarity scores together.

The task of event coreference resolution plays a critical role in many natural language processing applications such as information extraction, question answering, and topic detection and tracking. In this article, we describe a new class of unsupervised, nonparametric Bayesian models with the purpose of probabilistically inferring coreference clusters of event mentions from a collection of unlabeled documents. In order to infer these clusters, we automatically extract various lexical, syntactic, and semantic features for each event mention from the document collection. Extracting a rich set of features for each event mention allows us to cast event coreference resolution as the task of grouping together the mentions that share the same features (they have the same participating entities, share the same location, happen at the same time, etc.). Some of the most important challenges posed by the resolution of event coreference in an unsupervised way stem from (a) the choice of representing event mentions through a rich set of features and (b) the ability of modeling events described both within the same document and across multiple documents. Our first unsupervised model that addresses these challenges is a generalization of the hierarchical Dirichlet process. This new extension presents the hierarchical Dirichlet process’s ability to capture the uncertainty regarding the number of clustering components and, additionally, takes into account any finite number of features associated with each event mention. Furthermore, to overcome some of the limitations of this extension, we devised a new hybrid model, which combines an infinite latent class model with a discrete time series model. The main advantage of this hybrid model stands in its capability to automatically infer the number of features associated with each event mention from data and, at the same time, to perform an automatic selection of the most informative features for the task of event coreference. The evaluation performed for solving both within- and cross-document event coreference shows significant improvements of these models when compared against two baselines for this task.

Using clues from event semantics to solve coreference, we present an “event template” approach to cross-document event coreference resolution on news articles.

The templates, filled in on the sentence level for every event mention from the data set, are used for supervised classification. In this study, we determine granularity of events and we use the grain size as a clue for solving event coreference. We experiment with a newly-created granularity ontology employing granularity levels of locations, times and human participants as well as event durations as features in event coreference resolution. The granularity ontology is available for research. Results show that determining granularity along semantic event slots, even on the sentence level exclusively, improves precision and solves event coreference with scores comparable to those achieved in related work.

We hypothesize that exploiting the inter-dependencies between these components can significantly improve the performance of an event coreference resolver, and subsequently propose a novel joint inference based event coreference resolver using Markov Logic Networks (MLNs). However, the rich features that are important for this task are typically very hard to explicitly encode as MLN formulas since they significantly increase the size of the MLN, thereby making joint inference and learning infeasible. To address this problem, we propose a novel solution where we implicitly encode rich features into our model by augmenting the MLN distribution with low dimensional unit clauses.

We address two key challenges in end-to-end event coreference resolution research: (1) the error propagation problem, where an event coreference resolver has to assume as input the noisy outputs produced by its upstream components in the standard information extraction (IE) pipeline; and (2) the data annotation bottleneck, where manually annotating data for all the components in the IE pipeline is prohibitively expensive. This is the case in the vast majority of the world's natural languages, where such annotated resources are not readily available. To address these problems, we propose to perform joint inference over a lightly supervised IE pipeline, where all the models are trained using either active learning or unsupervised learning. Using our approach, only 25% of the training sentences in the Chinese portion of the ACE 2005 corpus need to be annotated with entity and event mentions in order for our event coreference resolver to surpass its fully supervised counterpart in performance.

The difficulty in designing high-precision rules makes it challenging to successfully apply a multi-pass sieve approach to event coreference resolution.

Event extraction, a specialized stream of information extraction rooted back into the 1980s, has greatly gained in popularity due to the advent of big data and the developments in the related fields of text mining and natural language processing. However, up to this date, an overview of this particular field remains elusive. Therefore, we give a summarization of event extraction techniques for textual data, distinguishing between data-driven, knowledge-driven, and hybrid methods, and present a qualitative evaluation of these. Moreover, we discuss common decision support applications of event extraction from text corpora. Last, we elaborate on the evaluation of event extraction systems and identify current research issues.

One of the crucial methods of thosesystems is the open domain event extraction, which aims atextracting  meaningful  event  information  without  any  pre-defined  domain  assumption.   Combining  with  some  recentpromising  techniques  including  Question  Answer  pairing,entity linking, entity coreference and deep learning, the re-sult of open domain extraction seems to be improved.

Twitter is among the fastest-growing microblogging and online social networking services. Messages posted on Twitter tweets have been reporting everything from daily life stories to the latest local and global news and events. Monitoring and analyzing this rich and continuous user-generated content can yield unprecedentedly valuable information, enabling users and organizations to acquire actionable knowledge. This article provides a survey of techniques for event detection from Twitter streams. These techniques aim at finding real-world occurrences that unfold over space and time. In contrast to conventional media, event detection from Twitter streams poses new challenges. Twitter streams contain large amounts of meaningless messages and polluted content, which negatively affect the detection performance. In addition, traditional text mining techniques are not suitable, because of the short length of tweets, the large number of spelling and grammatical errors, and the frequent use of informal and mixed language. Event detection techniques presented in literature address these issues by adapting techniques from various fields to the uniqueness of Twitter. This article classifies these techniques according to the event type, detection task, and detection method and discusses commonly used features. Finally, it highlights the need for public benchmarks to evaluate the performance of different detection approaches and various features.

Microblogs are a tremendous repository of user-generated content about world events. However, for people trying to understand events by querying services like Twitter, a chronological log of posts makes it very difﬁcult to get a detailed understanding of an event. In this paper, we present TwitInfo, a system for visualizing and summarizing events on Twitter. TwitInfo allows users to browse a large collection of tweets using a timeline-based display that highlights peaks of high tweet activity. A novel streaming algorithm automatically discovers these peaks and labels them meaningfully using text from the tweets. Users can drill down to subevents, and explore further via geolocation, sentiment, and popular URLs. We contribute a recall-normalized aggregate sentiment visualization to produce more honest sentiment overviews. An evaluation of the system revealed that users were able to reconstruct meaningful summaries of events in a small amount of time. An interview with a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist suggested that the system would be especially useful for understanding a long-running event and for identifying eyewitnesses. Quantitatively, our system can identify 80-100\% of manually labeled peaks, facilitating a relatively complete view of each event studied.

A large portion of real world data are either text data or structured (e.g., relational) data. Moreover, such data are often linked together (e.g., structured speciﬁcation of products linking with the corresponding product descriptions and customer comments).

The EventCube project constructs TextCube and TopicCube from interconnected structured and text data (or from text data via entity extraction and dimension building), and performs multidimensional search and analysis on such datasets, in an informative, powerful, and userfriendly manner. This proposed EventCube demo will show the power of the system not only on the originally designed ASRS (Aviation Safety Report System) data sets, but also on news datasets, collected from multiple news agencies. The system has high potential to be extended in many powerful ways and serve as a general platform for search, OLAP (online analytical processing) and data mining on integrated text and structured data.

Today’s event ordering research is heavily dependent on annotated corpora. Current corpora inﬂuence shared evaluations and drive algorithm development. Partly due to this dependence, most research focuses on partial orderings of a document’s events. For instance, the TempEval competitions and the TimeBank only annotate small portions of the event graph, focusing on the most salient events or on speciﬁc types of event pairs (e.g., only events in the same sentence). Deeper temporal reasoners struggle with this sparsity because the entire temporal picture is not represented. This paper proposes a new annotation process with a mechanism to force annotators to label connected graphs. It generates 10 times more relations per document than the TimeBank, and our TimeBank-Dense corpus is larger than all current corpora. We hope this process and its dense corpus encourages research on new global models with deeper reasoning.

Cross-narrative temporal ordering of medical events is essential to the task of generating a comprehensive timeline over a patient’s history. We address the problem of aligning multiple medical event sequences, corresponding to different clinical narratives, comparing the following approaches: (1) A novel weighted ﬁnite state transducer representation of medical event sequences that enables composition and search for decoding, and (2) Dynamic programming with iterative pairwise alignment of multiple sequences using global and local alignment algorithms. The cross-narrative coreference and temporal relation weights used in both these approaches are learned from a corpus of clinical narratives. We present results using both approaches and observe that the ﬁnite state transducer approach performs performs signiﬁcantly better than the dynamic programming one by 6.8\% for the problem of multiple-sequence alignment.

This paper presents a generative model to event schema induction. Previous methods in the literature only use head words to represent entities.

Mostly, it makes topic distributions more coherent and more discriminative. Experimental results on benchmark dataset empirically conﬁrm this enhancement.

Knowledge bases, which consist of a collection of entities, attributes, and the relations between them are widely used and important for many information retrieval tasks. Knowledge base schemas are often constructed manually using experts with speciﬁc domain knowledge for the ﬁeld of interest. Once the knowledge base is generated then many tasks such as automatic content extraction and knowledge base population can be performed, which have so far been robustly studied by the Natural Language Processing community. However, the current approaches ignore visual information that could be used to build or populate these structured ontologies. Preliminary work on visual knowledge base construction only explores limited basic objects and scene relations. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal pattern mining approach towards constructing a high-level “event” schema semi-automatically, which has the capability to extend text only methods for schema construction. We utilize a large unconstrained corpus of weakly-supervised image-caption pairs related to high-level events such as “attack” and “demonstration” to both discover visual aspects of an event, and name these visual components automatically. We compare our method with several state-of-the-art visual pattern mining approaches and demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve dramatic improvements in terms of the number of concepts discovered (33\% gain), semantic consistence of visual patterns (52\% gain), and correctness of pattern naming (150\% gain).

Today’s extraction of temporal information for events heavily depends on annotated temporal links. These so called TLINKs capture the relation between pairs of event mentions and time expressions. One problem is that the number of possible TLINKs grows quadratic with the number of event mentions, therefore most annotation studies concentrate on links for mentions in the same or in adjacent sentences. However, as our annotation study shows, this restriction results for 58\% of the event mentions in a less precise information when the event took place.

In this paper we describe a new lexical semantic resource, The Rich Event On-tology, which provides an independent conceptual backbone to unify existing semantic role labeling (SRL) schemas and augment them with event-to-event causal and temporal relations. By unifying the FrameNet, VerbNet, Automatic Content Extraction, and Rich Entities, Relations and Events resources, the ontology serves as a shared hub for the disparate annotation schemas and therefore enables the combination of SRL training data into a larger, more diverse corpus. By adding temporal and causal relational information not found in any of the independent resources, the ontology facilitates reasoning on and across documents, revealing relationships between events that come together in temporal and causal chains to build more complex scenarios. We envision the open resource serving as a valuable tool for both moving from the ontology to text to query for event types and scenarios of interest, and for moving from text to the ontology to access interpretations of events using the combined semantic information housed there.

A semantics of temporal categories in language and a theory of their use in defining the temporal relations between events both require a more complex structure on the domain underlying the meaning representations than is commonly assumed. This paper proposes an ontology based on such notions as causation and consequence, rather than on purely temporal primitives. A central notion in the ontology is that of an elementary event-complex called a "nucleus." A nucleus can be thought of as an association of a goal event, or "culmination," with a "preparatory process" by which it is accomplished, and a "consequent state," which ensues. Natural-language categories like aspects, futurates, adverbials, and when-clauses are argued to change the temporal/aspectual category of propositions under the control of such a nucleic knowledge representation structure. The same concept of a nucleus plays a central role in a theory of temporal reference, and of the semantics of tense, which we follow McCawley, Partee, and Isard in regarding as an anaphoric category. We claim that any manageable formalism for natural- language temporal descriptions will have to embody such an ontology, as will any usable temporal database for knowledge about events which is to be interrogated using natural language.

We present Event2018, a corpus annotated for event detection tasks, consisting of 38 million tweets in French (retweets excluded) including more than 130,000 tweets manually annotated by three annotators as related or unrelated to a given event. The 243 events were selected both from press articles and from subjects trending on Twitter during the annotation period (July to August 2018). In total, more than 95,000 tweets were annotated as related to one of the selected events. We also provide the titles and URLs of 15,500 news articles automatically detected as related to these events. In addition to this corpus, we detail the results of our event detection experiments on both this dataset and another publicly available dataset of tweets in English. We ran extensive tests with different types of text embeddings and a standard Topic Detection and Tracking algorithm, and detail our evaluation method. We show that tf-idf vectors allow the best performance for this task on both corpora. These results are intended to serve as a baseline for researchers wishing to test their own event detection systems on our corpus.

This paper proposes a corpus for the development and evaluation of tools and techniques for identifying emerging infectious disease threats in online news text. The corpus can not only be used for information extraction, but also for other natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as text classification. We make use of articles published on the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED) platform, which provides current information about outbreaks of infectious diseases globally. Among the key pieces of information present in the articles is the uniform resource locator (URL) to the online news sources where the outbreaks were originally reported. We detail the procedure followed to build the dataset, which includes leveraging the source URLs to retrieve the news reports and subsequently pre-processing the retrieved documents. We also report on experimental results of event extraction on the dataset using the Data Analysis for Information Extraction in any Language(DAnIEL) system. DAnIEL is a multilingual news surveillance system that leverages unique attributes associated with news reporting to extract events: repetition and saliency. The system has wide geographical and language coverage, including low-resource languages. In addition, we compare different classification approaches in terms of their ability to differentiate between epidemic-related and unrelated news articles that constitute the corpus.

The classification of implicit emotions in text has always been a great challenge to emotion processing. Even though the majority of emotion expressed implicitly, most previous attempts at emotions have focused on the examination of explicit emotions. The poor performance of existing emotion identification and classification models can partly be attributed to the disregard of implicit emotions. In view of this, this paper presents the development of a Chinese event-comment social media emotion corpus. The corpus deals with both explicit and implicit emotions with more emphasis being placed on the implicit ones. This paper specifically describes the data collection and annotation of the corpus. An annotation scheme has been proposed for the annotation of emotion-related information including the emotion type, the emotion cause, the emotion reaction, the use of rhetorical question, the opinion target (i.e. the semantic role in an event that triggers an emotion), etc. Corpus data shows that the annotated items are of great value to the identification of implicit emotions. We believe that the corpus will be a useful resource for both explicit and implicit emotion classification and detection as well as event classification.

The rise of social media platforms makes it a valuable information source of recent events and users’ perspective towards them. Twitter has been one of the most important communication platforms in recent years. Event detection, one of the information extraction aspects, involves identifying specified types of events in the text. Detecting events from tweets can help to predict real-world events precisely. A serious challenge that faces Arabic event detection is the lack of Arabic datasets that can be exploited in detecting events. This paper will describe FloDusTA, which is a dataset of tweets that we have built for the purpose of developing an event detection system. The dataset contains tweets written in both Modern Standard Arabic and Saudi dialect. The process of building the dataset starting from tweets collection to annotation by human annotators will be present. The tweets are labeled with four labels: flood, dust storm, traffic accident, and non-event. The dataset was tested for classification and the result was strongly encouraging.

In today’s era of globalisation, the increased outreach for every event across the world has been leading to conflicting opinions, arguments and disagreements, often reflected in print media and online social platforms. It is necessary to distinguish factual observations from personal judgements in news, as subjectivity in reporting can influence the audience’s perception of reality. Several studies conducted on the different styles of reporting in journalism are essential in understanding phenomena such as media bias and multiple interpretations of the same event. This domain finds applications in fields such as Media Studies, Discourse Analysis, Information Extraction, Sentiment Analysis, and Opinion Mining. We present an event corpus Manovaad-v1.0 consisting of 1035 news articles corresponding to 65 events from 3 levels of newspapers viz., Local, National, and International levels. Using this novel format, we correlate the trends in the degree of subjectivity with the geographical closeness of reporting using a Bi-RNN model. We also analyse the role of background and focus in event reporting and capture the focus shift patterns within a global discourse structure for an event. We do this across different levels of reporting and compare the results with the existing work on discourse processing.

Event detection (ED), which identifies event trigger words and classifies event types according to contexts, is the first and most fundamental step for extracting event knowledge from plain text. Most existing datasets exhibit the following issues that limit further development of ED: (1) Small scale of existing datasets is not sufficient for training and stably benchmarking increasingly sophisticated modern neural methods. (2) Limited event types of existing datasets lead to the trained models cannot be easily adapted to general-domain scenarios. To alleviate these problems, we present a MAssive eVENt detection dataset (MAVEN), which contains 4,480 Wikipedia documents, 117,200 event mention instances, and 207 event types. MAVEN alleviates the lack of data problem and covers much more general event types. Besides the dataset, we reproduce the recent state-of-the-art ED models and conduct a thorough evaluation for these models on MAVEN. The experimental results and empirical analyses show that existing ED methods cannot achieve promising results as on the small datasets, which suggests ED in real world remains a challenging task and requires further research efforts. The dataset and baseline code will be released in the future to promote this field.

Detecting cybersecurity events is necessary to keep us informed about the fast growing number of such events reported in text. In this work, we focus on the task of event detection (ED) to identify event trigger words for the cybersecurity domain. In particular, to facilitate the future research, we introduce a new dataset for this problem, characterizing the manual annotation for 30 important cybersecurity event types and a large dataset size to develop deep learning models. Comparing to the prior datasets for this task, our dataset involves more event types and supports the modeling of document-level information to improve the performance. We perform extensive evaluation with the current state-of-the-art methods for ED on the proposed dataset. Our experiments reveal the challenges of cybersecurity ED and present many research opportunities in this area for the future work.
